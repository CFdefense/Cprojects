# Doom Game
This project is a Console Application which mimicks 3d graphics using raycasting, Unicode and collision detection using C++. With this project, I hope to gain a better understanding of C++ and raytracing. The game will function similiarly to games such as Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. 

## Demo

## Inspiration 
I got the inspiration and followed the guide of [Javidx9's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw&list=PL36enNxU148RzQ8zwL8FHgg7ef_-5p3cQ) walkthrough of the program which helped alot in understanding some more of the complicated math having to do with raytracing and writing to the console.

## Progression
Following the walkthrough I plan to progress the project into an actual shooter in which the user progresses through some levels, shooting and killing enemies to reach the end. 

## Future Project Goals
1. Implement Static/Dynamic Enemies 
2. Shooting UI, function, and collision detection
3. Start Menu
4. Level Select
5. Fix pause no-clip glitch -> Implemented
6. Pause Menu -> Implemented
